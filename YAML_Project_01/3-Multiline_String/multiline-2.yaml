   "In the age of proliferation, organizations must have a polished 
   and well-managed system for various operations. The field of Project management
   and its zeal and potential to contrive any project has fascinated me for a long. 
   I am always interested in knowing the methodology and working process of 
   any mechanical equipment around me. Even my family members used to get annoyed by
   my questions of how and why. Being a curious child since my childhood, Engineering
   was my ultimate choice for undergraduate studies from a very early age."

   "I decided to pursue engineering in civil as it is a core branch.
   It could be a possible full stop for my keenness to know the thought
   process and strategies behind the construction of sky-touching infrastructures.
   But the completion of my degree leads to a drastic hike in my eagerness to learn 
   more about actual game plans behind real world projects. I have completed my 
   Bachelorâ€™s degree from Jaypee University of Information technology with a 7.6 CGPA 
   in 2020. Through this course, I have gained deep acumen into the world of civil 
   engineering and got an idea about how vast this field is. 
   While studying resource management in my third year of graduation, I realized that 
   this specific field has my all interest. Through this subject, I learned the 
   fundamentals of Work Breakdown Structure which illustrates the targets we want
   to accomplish in any project. In my view, proper management of resources can 
   turn anybody into a successful person in his life."
